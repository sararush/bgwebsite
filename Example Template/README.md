Hey guys, this is just a sample one that's preformatted for multiple window sizes and the like.
Attaced should be some relevant images (I'll look for more as the week goes on), as well as some sections I've already used prior.
The Contact Us section is pretty simple, just put in the relevant emails (info@ as well as others if you want) while some other portions 
may be a bit more difficult (Store, Samples). I'll try to come back to help out with the samples portion, I think there's a portfolio section
that I can re-reference considering I deleted it in the past. LMK if there are any problems, I'll be finishing up some other projects by the
end of this week but I can definitely find time to help out if you need me to. -Keon
